/**
 * GBP is our representation of real, British money. The kind of money you can depend on, that has stood up to the
 * Blitz and the Communists, to the bankers and the unchecked immigration. The kind of money you can sink your teeth
 * into and be assured of good, old-fashioned, British germs, the kind of germs that apologise (with an 's', no less!)
 * before ravaging your organs for the precious, colonial resources upon which the Empire was built. The money of
 * Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left
 * foot, come to that! Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves! Send her victorious, happy and glorious, long to reign
 * over us, God save the GBP!
